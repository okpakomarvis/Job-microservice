## Job Microservice Application with Zipkin Tracing
### Overview
This project implements a Job Microservice Architecture with three key microservices: Job Microservice, Company Microservice, and Review Microservice. These services interact through Spring Cloud Eureka for service discovery and are deployed using Docker containers. The system utilizes Zipkin for distributed tracing, providing enhanced observability and performance monitoring across microservices.
